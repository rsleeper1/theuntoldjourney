# The Untold Journey
Capstone Project SWDV 691

This application is a simple adventure game that is meant to help grade school students with basic fundamental math concepts. In particular, this game will focus on adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational numbers. This adventure game was developed in hopes that it will keep students more engaged throughout the learning experience. Many students do not like math because they do not understand it at first and give up trying to solve problems rather quickly. The Untold Journey will keep the students engaged by incorporating an exciting adventure to supplement the math questions. There will also be tips to assist students struggling with any question they come across while playing the game.
